      Answer each question by choosing the number that best characterizes your performance.
      To obtain the most accurate results, it's essential that you score each question according
      to your most recent experiences on the rock. Pause for a moment and review recent climbs
      to determin the correct answer for each question. Do not overanaylize the questions however,
      or try to read between the lines--you will have a chance to ponder the meaning of your answers
      when final counts are tallied for you.
